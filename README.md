# Learning React

1. What is React?
Itâ€™s a JavaScript [library](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-difference-between-a-framework-and-a-library-bd133054023f/) for building User Interfaces created and mostly maintained by Facebook. 
The UI is composed of small units (text boxes, buttons, images, etc) and React allows us to combine them into reusable and nestable components and then rendering and updating the UI whenever it changes.
